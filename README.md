# Remove History in YouTube

A Chrome extension that automatically removes content from your YouTube watch history based on customizable regex patterns to prevent YouTube from recommending unwanted videos based on your viewing history.

## üéØ Purpose

YouTube's recommendation algorithm uses your watch history to suggest new videos. If you've watched content in the past that you no longer want to see, YouTube will continue recommending similar videos. This extension helps you clean up your YouTube history by automatically removing content that matches your custom patterns.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Customizable Detection**: Identifies content using user-defined regex patterns
- **Auto-Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls through your entire YouTube history to load more content
- **Dual Platform Support**: Works on both YouTube Activity page and YouTube Feed History
- **Safety Mechanisms**: Prevents infinite scrolling and includes error handling
- **Real-time Removal**: Removes matching content as it's discovered
- **Web Configuration**: Easy-to-use web interface for all settings
