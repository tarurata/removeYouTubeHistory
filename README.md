# Remove Japanese History in YouTube

A Chrome extension that automatically removes Japanese content from your YouTube watch history to prevent YouTube from recommending Japanese videos based on your viewing history.

## üéØ Purpose

YouTube's recommendation algorithm uses your watch history to suggest new videos. If you've watched Japanese content in the past, YouTube will continue recommending Japanese videos even if you no longer want to see them. This extension helps you clean up your YouTube history by automatically removing Japanese content.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies Japanese content using Unicode character detection with Regex
- **Auto-Scrolling**: Automatically scrolls through your entire YouTube history to load more content
- **Dual Platform Support**: Works on both YouTube Activity page and YouTube Feed History
- **Real-time Removal**: Removes Japanese content as it's discovered

## üìñ How to Use

### Step 2: Let It Run

## üîß How It Works

### Content Detection
The extension uses Unicode character detection to identify Japanese content:
- **Hiragana**: `\u3040-\u309F`
- **Katakana**: `\u30A0-\u30FF`
- **Kanji**: `\u4E00-\u9FBF`
- **Japanese Punctuation**: `\u3000-\u303F`

### Automatic Scrolling
- Scrolls to the bottom of the page to load more content
- Detects when new content is loaded by comparing page heights
- Continues scrolling until no new content is found
- Includes safety mechanisms to prevent infinite scrolling

### Removal Process
1. **Scan**: Identifies YouTube activity cards with Japanese content
2. **Click**: Automatically clicks the delete button for each item
3. **Confirm**: Waits for deletion confirmation
4. **Continue**: Moves to the next item
